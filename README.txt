This is a .NET Core solution built using the CLI and Visual Studio Code

To run the tests from the command line, go to the FileData.Tests folder and type:
dotnet test

To run the console application from the command line, go to the FileData folder and type:
dotnet run -- "-v" "f"
or
dotnet run -- "-s" "f"

Alternatively, publish the console app to create an exe which can be run directly from the command line.
